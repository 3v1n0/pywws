pywws
=====

Python software for USB Wireless WeatherStations.

This is a small fork of official pywws that supports the [Citizen Weather Observer Program](http://www.wxqa.com/) (CWOP)
protocol, sending data through the APRS protocol.

Unfortunately upstream is not interested on supporting this small service, so
I've made this repository, but with the intent of keeping it as close as possible
to upstream.
