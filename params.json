{"note":"Don't delete this file!

It can be used to create graphs and web pages showing recent weather readings, typically updated every hour. It can also send data to services such as [Weather Underground](http://www.wunderground.com/) and post messages to [Twitter](https://twitter.com/).\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\nThe software you'll need to run pywws depends on what you plan to do with it. In particular, there is a choice of USB library, to suit what's available on different operating systems.\r\n\r\n* [Python](http://www.python.org/) version 2.4 or higher (note: Python 3 is not yet supported)\r\n* USB library option 1:\r\n  * [libusb](http://libusb.sf.net) version 0.1.12 (note: libusb 1 is not supported)\r\n  * [PyUSB](http://pyusb.berlios.de/) version 0.4.x\r\n* USB library option 2:\r\n  * [hidapi](https://github.com/signal11/hidapi)\r\n  * [cython-hidapi](https://github.com/gbishop/cython-hidapi)\r\n  * [cython](http://cython.org/)\r\n* For graph drawing:\r\n  * [gnuplot](http://www.gnuplot.info/) v4.2 or higher\r\n* For secure website uploading (sftp)\r\n  * [paramiko](http://www.lag.net/paramiko/)\r\n  * [pycrypto](http://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/)\r\n* For Twitter updates:\r\n  * [tweepy](http://code.google.com/p/tweepy/)\r\n  * [simplejson](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/simplejson)\r\n* To create new language translations:\r\n  * [gettext](http://www.gnu.org/s/gettext/)\r\n\r\n## Getting a copy of pywws\r\n\r\nThe simplest way to obtain pywws is to download a zip or tar.gz file from the [download page](https://github.com/jim-easterbrook/pywws/downloads) and then extract the files into a convenient directory on your computer. These \"archive\" files contain a snapshot release of the software - a new one is released every few months.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to try the latest version of pywws, please use git to clone the [repository](https://github.com/jim-easterbrook/pywws). After doing so you'll need to use make to compile the documentation and language localisation files.\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\nDocumentation is included with pywws downloads, and is also [available online](doc/html/). A good starting place is the [how to get started guide](doc/html/guides/getstarted.html) which describes in more detail how to install pywws.\r\n\r\nIf you have questions not answered in the documentation, please join the [pywws Google mailing list / discussion group](http://groups.google.com/group/pywws) and ask there.\r\n\r\n![Weather station sensors.](http://www.jim-easterbrook.me.uk/weather/img_1504.jpg)\r\n\r\n## Legalese\r\n\r\npywws - Python software for USB Wireless WeatherStations.\r\n\r\nhttp://jim-easterbrook.github.com/pywws/\r\n\r\nCopyright (C) 2008-12 Jim Easterbrook jim@jim-easterbrook.me.uk\r\n\r\nThis program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

I am also indebted to Dave Wells for decoding the [weather station's \"fixed block\" data](http://www.jim-easterbrook.me.uk/weather/mm/).","name":"pywws","google":"","tagline":"Python software for USB Wireless WeatherStations"}
